 Neither the drivers nor library should be considered mature, stable or fit for purpose in this release.

 The primary purpose of this release is pedagogy.
 
 The fact that we are able to reproduce a number of published results does provide confidence
 that what is presented in this release is useful, tested and reasonably trustworthy.
 
 The purpose of the effort was to show what could be done to develop within one week a library
 that would explain the development process and successfully run the driver code in Chapter 8
 of the book to reproduce collapse and revival behaviour of the Jaynes–Cummings model.
 
 I also wanted to make the library self-contained so advantage was not made of built in
 protocols such as AdditiveArithmetic or the Numerics package that was released shortly after the
 first draft of the code was completed.
 
 Good practice such as logging has yet to be included and no attempt has been made to properly
 optimise any of the methods. In addition features such as tensor product need generalisation.
 In short there is much room for improvement.
 
 That said the code is usable and should enable rapid solution of even quite complex problems.
 Feedback is welcome on how to improve the code, especially at this stage of immaturity where
 good suggestions are most likely to result in substantial improvements.
 
 The remaining code in this folder was added after the code for chapter 8 was complete and
 contains the source for the cover and all other figures where computation was necessary.
 This should enable the reader to check the validity and reproduce those results and to preform
 computational experiments to explore the physics beyond the content of the text.
 
 Data is generally produced in tab delimited text for plotting in third party packages such as
 gnuplot or pgfplots.
 
 My plan is to now evaluate and develop this code base into a fully functional library. Some
 important design choices need to be made (such as the potential to adopt Numerics) and a
 careful evolution is planned before a final  suitable community release is made.
